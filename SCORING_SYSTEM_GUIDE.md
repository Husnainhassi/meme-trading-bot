1. Volume Surge Detection (25 points)
Recent 1h/5m/15m Volume Spike:
If the token’s trading volume in the last hour is much higher than its historical average, it gets more points.
Explosive, sudden volume = higher score.
Example:
1h volume > 10x previous hour = +25 points
1h volume > 5x previous hour = +15 points
1h volume > 2x previous hour = +5 points
2. Social Momentum Tracking (20 points)
Twitter/Reddit/Telegram Activity:
Points for rapid increases in mentions, engagement, or group activity.
Example:
Trending on Twitter/Reddit = +10 points
Telegram group surging = +5 points
Influencer/KOL mentions = +5 points
3. Smart Money Signals (20 points)
Large Wallet Accumulation:
Points for new large holders or “smart money” buying in.
Example:
Multiple new large wallets = +10 points
Smart money detected = +10 points
4. Technical Foundation (15 points)
Liquidity Lock:
Liquidity locked for > 6 months = +7 points
Locked for 1-6 months = +3 points
Unlocked = 0 points
Contract Verification:
Verified contract = +3 points
Unverified = 0 points
Ownership Distribution:
No single wallet > 5% = +5 points
High concentration = 0 points
5. Timing Factors (10 points)
Market Cycle & Competition:
Launches during meme season = +5 points
Few competing launches = +3 points
Optimal entry window = +2 points
6. Risk Assessment (Deductions)
Honeypot/Scam Detection:
Proven honeypot = -100 points (auto-disqualify)
Unlocked Liquidity:
Not locked = -10 points
High Wallet Concentration:
Top 10 wallets > 50% = -10 points
Suspicious Trading Patterns:
Obvious bot activity or wash trading = -10 points
New Token (very recent):
< 1 hour old = -5 points
7. Critical Red Flags (Auto-Disqualify)
If any of these are detected, the token’s score is set to 0 and it is not signaled:
Honeypot detected
Insufficient liquidity
Major contract risks
Example Calculation
Suppose a token has:

1h volume 12x previous hour (+25)
Trending on Twitter (+10)
2 new large wallets (+10)
Liquidity locked 8 months (+7)
Verified contract (+3)
No single wallet > 5% (+5)
Launches during meme season (+5)
No major red flags
Total Score: 25 + 10 + 10 + 7 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 65/100 (Tier B: Pump Potential)

Summary:
Each feature or checklist item adds or subtracts a specific number of points. The total score determines the token’s tier and whether it gets signaled. Critical red flags can override all positives and set the score to zero. This system is designed to reward real-time meme coin “pump” conditions and filter out scams and weak projects.
